1. **Main Clock Crystal**:
    
    - The main crystal oscillator, usually operating at 16 MHz, provides the primary clock signal for the microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328P). This crystal determines the basic clock frequency of the microcontroller and is essential for its operation.
    
1. **Secondary Clock Crystal or Resonator**:
    
    - Some Arduino boards may include a secondary crystal or resonator for a specific purpose. This secondary crystal or resonator might be used for various functions such as providing a clock signal for communication interfaces like USB (Universal Serial Bus) or other timing-sensitive peripherals.

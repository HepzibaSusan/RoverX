  
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that is widely used in hobbyist electronics project, real time projects and educational demonstrations. It is very simple, versatile and highly accessible.

At its core, Arduino consists of both hardware and software components:

   1. **Arduino Boards**  These are physical circuit boards equipped with microcontrollers and various [[GPIO]] pins that allow users to connect sensors, actuators, and other electronic components, USB ports, etc. The most common Arduino board is the Arduino Uno, but there are numerous variations available, each catering to specific needs and applications.

   2. **Arduino Software (IDE):** The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a user-friendly software application used to write, compile, and upload code to Arduino boards. It features a simplified programming language based on Wiring and C/C++, making it user friendly to beginners while still offering advanced functionality options for experienced users.
    

Key features of Arduino include:

- **Simplicity:** Arduino abstracts away much of the complexity of embedded systems development, allowing users to focus on their projects without needing an in-depth understanding of embedded C programming
- **Open-Source:** Arduino is built on open-source principles, meaning its hardware designs, software code, and documentation are freely available for anyone to study, modify, and distribute.
- **Extensibility:** Arduino supports a vast ecosystem of add-on modules, known as [[shields]] (e.g. WiFi or ethernet shield) , which can be easily stacked on top of Arduino boards to add functionality such as Wi-Fi connectivity, motor control, or sensor inputs.

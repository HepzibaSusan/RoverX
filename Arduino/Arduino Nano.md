1. **Microcontroller:** The Arduino Nano is powered by the ATmega328P microcontroller, which is a low-power, high-performance chip from Atmel. The ATmega328P features 32KB of flash memory for storing the program code, 2KB of SRAM for variables, and 1KB of EEPROM for data storage.
    
2. **Form Factor:** The Nano comes in a compact form factor, typically around 45mm x 18mm in size, making it suitable for small-scale projects and projects with limited space. It is often used in applications such as wearables, robotics, and embedded systems.
    
3. **Power Supply:** The Nano can be powered via USB connection or an external power source. It has a built-in voltage regulator that allows it to be powered with a supply voltage between 7V to 12V. It can also be powered directly from the USB port, which provides 5V.
    
4. **Input/Output Pins:** The Nano features a set of digital and analog input/output pins that can be used to interface with various sensors, actuators, and other electronic components. It typically has 14 digital I/O pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs) and 8 analog input pins.
    
5. **Communication Interfaces:** The Nano supports various communication interfaces, including UART (serial communication), I2C (two-wire serial communication), and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). These interfaces allow the Nano to communicate with other devices such as sensors, displays, and other microcontrollers.

6. **Programming:** Like other Arduino boards, the Nano can be programmed using the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which provides a user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the board. The programming language used is based on Wiring, a simplified version of C and C++.
    
7. **Built-in LEDs:** The Nano typically includes built-in LEDs for power indication and status indication. These LEDs can be controlled programmatically to provide visual feedback during operation.
    
8. **USB Interface:** The Nano features a USB interface for programming and serial communication with a computer. It uses a USB-to-serial converter chip (usually CH340G or FT232RL) to convert USB signals to serial signals that the microcontroller can understand.
    
9. **Expansion Headers:** The Nano has headers for connecting additional modules and [[shields]], allowing users to expand its functionality with add-on boards such as motor drivers, display modules, and wireless communication modules.

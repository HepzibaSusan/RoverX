The Arduino Due is a microcontroller board based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. It's one of the more powerful boards in the Arduino lineup, offering higher performance compared to the more common ATmega-based Arduino boards like the Uno or Mega.

Here are some key features and aspects of the Arduino Due:

1. **Microcontroller**: Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU running at  , which provides significantly more processing power and capabilities compared to the ATmega series used in other Arduino boards.
    
2. **Operating Voltage**: The operating voltage of the Due is 3.3 volts, which means that it's not directly compatible with 5V Arduino shields or sensors without [[level-shifting.]]
    
3. **Digital and Analog I/O**: The Arduino Due has 54 digital input/output pins, of which 12 can be used as PWM outputs. Additionally, it has 12 analog inputs, which can also be used as digital inputs/outputs.
    
4. **Communication**: It supports a variety of communication interfaces, including UART (Serial), SPI, I2C, CAN, and USB. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications requiring communication with other devices or peripherals.
    
5. **Memory**: The Due has 512 KB of Flash memory for storing your code (of which 96 KB is used by the bootloader) and 96 KB of SRAM for variables.
    
6. **Clock Speed**: The Arduino Due runs at 84 MHz, providing much higher processing speed compared to other Arduino boards. This makes it suitable for applications that require more computational power.
    
7. **Compatibility**: While the Due is compatible with most Arduino shields, due to its different voltage levels and pin configurations, some shields may require modification or use of level shifters to work properly.
    
8. **Development Environment**: You can program the Arduino Due using the Arduino Software (IDE), just like other Arduino boards. However, due to the differences in architecture and clock speed, some libraries and sketches may need modification to work properly on the Due.
    
9. **Applications**: Due's higher processing power and extensive communication capabilities make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including robotics, industrial automation, data logging, and more complex projects requiring real-time processing.

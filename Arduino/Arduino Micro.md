1. **Microcontroller:** The Arduino Micro is based on the ATmega32U4 microcontroller chip. The ATmega32U4 features 32KB of flash memory for storing the program code, 2.5KB of SRAM for variables, and 1KB of EEPROM for data storage.
    
2. **Form Factor:** The Micro comes in a compact form factor, typically around 48mm x 18mm in size, making it suitable for projects with space constraints. It is often used in applications where size and weight are critical factors, such as wearable devices, small robots, and portable gadgets.
    
3. **Power Supply:** The Micro can be powered via USB connection or an external power source. It has a built-in voltage regulator that allows it to be powered with a supply voltage between 7V to 12V. It can also be powered directly from the USB port, which provides 5V.
    
4. **Input/Output Pins:** The Micro features a set of digital and analog input/output pins that can be used to interface with various sensors, actuators, and other electronic components. It typically has 20 digital I/O pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs) and 12 analog input pins.
    
5. **Communication Interfaces:** The Micro supports various communication interfaces, including UART (serial communication), I2C (two-wire serial communication), and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). These interfaces allow the Micro to communicate with other devices such as sensors, displays, and other microcontrollers.

6. **Programming:** Like other Arduino boards, the Micro can be programmed using the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which provides a user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the board. The programming language used is based on Wiring, a simplified version of C and C++.
    
7. **Built-in LEDs:** The Micro typically includes built-in LEDs for power indication and status indication. These LEDs can be controlled programmatically to provide visual feedback during operation.
    
8. **USB Interface:** The Micro features a built-in USB interface for programming and serial communication with a computer. Unlike some other Arduino boards, the Micro uses the ATmega32U4's built-in USB support, eliminating the need for an external USB-to-serial converter chip.
    
9. **Expansion Headers:** The Micro has headers for connecting additional modules and shields, allowing users to expand its functionality with add-on boards such as motor drivers, display modules, and wireless communication modules.

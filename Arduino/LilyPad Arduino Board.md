### Specifications:

1. **Microcontroller**: The LilyPad Arduino typically uses the ATmega328P microcontroller, the same chip found in the Arduino Uno board. It operates at a clock frequency of **8 MHz.**
    
2. **Operating Voltage**: The LilyPad Arduino operates at 3.3 volts, making it compatible with a wide range of sensors, LEDs, and other electronic components commonly used in wearable projects.
    
3. **Digital I/O Pins**: It features 14 digital input/output (I/O) pins, of which 6 can be used as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) outputs for controlling brightness or speed.
    
4. **Analog Input Pins**: The LilyPad Arduino has 6 analog input pins, allowing it to read analog sensors or variable resistors such as potentiometers.
    
5. **Flash Memory**: It has 32 KB of Flash memory for storing your program (of which 2 KB is used by the bootloader).
    
6. **SRAM**: The LilyPad Arduino has 2 KB of SRAM for storing variables used in your program.
    
7. **EEPROM**: It includes 1 KB of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) for storing data that needs to persist between power cycles.
    
8. **Power Options**: The LilyPad Arduino can be powered via a coin cell battery, a rechargeable LiPo (Lithium Polymer) battery, or an external power supply connected to the pins marked "VBAT" or "VIN."
    
9. **Size and Shape**: The LilyPad Arduino is designed to be sewn onto fabric or garments using conductive thread. It has a round shape with sewable tabs around the perimeter for easy attachment to textiles.
    

### Features:

1. **Wearable Design**: The LilyPad Arduino is specifically designed for wearable electronics projects, allowing you to embed microcontroller functionality into clothing, accessories, and other fabric-based creations.
    
2. **Sewable**: Its sewable design and round shape make it easy to stitch onto fabric using conductive thread, enabling you to create interactive and responsive wearable designs.

3. **Washable**: Some LilyPad Arduino boards are designed to be washable, allowing garments or accessories incorporating the board to be laundered without damaging the electronics. This feature is achieved through special coatings and waterproofing techniques.

  
SRAM stands for Static Random Access Memory. It's a type of volatile memory commonly used in computer systems, microcontrollers, and other digital devices for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly and frequently during program execution.

### Key Features of SRAM:

1. **Volatility**: SRAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses its stored data when power is removed. Unlike non-volatile memory types such as EEPROM or flash memory, SRAM requires continuous power to maintain its contents.
    
2. **Speed**: SRAM offers fast access times and low latency, making it suitable for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly by the CPU or other processing units. Access times for SRAM are typically measured in nanoseconds.
    
3. **Cell Structure**: SRAM cells consist of multiple transistors configured in a flip-flop arrangement. This structure allows SRAM to retain data as long as power is applied, without the need for constant refreshing like dynamic RAM (DRAM).
    
4. **Read/Write Operations**: SRAM supports both read and write operations, allowing data to be read from and written to the memory at high speeds. Write operations are typically as fast as read operations in SRAM.
    
5. **Random Access**: SRAM provides random access to individual memory locations, meaning any memory location can be accessed directly without the need to traverse through other locations sequentially.
    
6. **Low Power Consumption**: Compared to dynamic RAM (DRAM), SRAM consumes relatively low power since it doesn't require periodic refresh cycles to maintain data integrity.

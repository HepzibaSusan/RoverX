  
In Arduino, GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins are the interface points on the microcontroller that can be configured as either inputs or outputs. These pins allow the microcontroller to interact with the external world by reading digital signals (inputs) from sensors, buttons, switches, etc., and by controlling various components such as LEDs, motors, relays, and displays (outputs).


1. **Digital I/O Pins**: These pins can be individually configured as either digital inputs or outputs. They are labeled with numbers (e.g., D2, D3, ..., D13 on Arduino Uno) and are often used for tasks such as reading button presses, detecting the state of sensors, or controlling digital devices like LEDs.
    
2. **Analog Input Pins**: While not strictly GPIO pins, Arduino boards have analog input pins labeled with the prefix "A" (e.g., A0, A1, ..., A5 on Arduino Uno). **These pins can read analog voltage levels from sensors and convert them into digital values using the [[analog-to-digital converter (ADC)]] built into the microcontroller.**
    
3. **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Pins**: Some digital I/O pins on Arduino boards support PWM, which allows them to simulate analog output by varying the duty cycle of a square wave. These pins are often labeled with a tilde symbol  ( e.g. D5~, ..., D13~ on Arduino Uno).)
    
4. **Special Function Pins**: In addition to GPIO pins, Arduino boards may have special function pins for specific purposes such as serial communication (RX, TX), SPI (MISO, MOSI, SCK), I2C (SDA, SCL), interrupt inputs (INT0, INT1, etc.), and power supply (VCC, GND).
    

It's important to note that the specific number and arrangement of GPIO pins may vary between different Arduino boards.

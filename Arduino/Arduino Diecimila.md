  
*"Diecimila" means "ten thousand" in Italian, signifying the approximate number of Arduino boards in circulation at the time of its release.*
### Specifications:

1. **Microcontroller**: The Arduino Diecimila features the ATmega168 or ATmega328 microcontroller, depending on the specific version. Both microcontrollers are from the AVR family produced by Atmel.
    
2. **Clock Frequency**: The ATmega168 version operates at 16 MHz, while the ATmega328 version can operate at both 16 MHz and 8 MHz.
    
3. **Operating Voltage**: The operating voltage of the Arduino Diecimila is 5 volts, which is the standard voltage used by most Arduino boards.
    
4. **Digital I/O Pins**: It has a total of 14 digital input/output pins, of which 6 can be used as PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) outputs.
    
5. **Analog Input Pins**: The Arduino Diecimila provides 6 analog input pins, allowing for the reading of analog sensors or variable resistors such as potentiometers.
    
6. **Flash Memory**: The ATmega168 version has 16 KB of Flash memory for storing the program, while the ATmega328 version has 32 KB of Flash memory.
    
7. **SRAM**: Both versions of the Arduino Diecimila have 1 KB of SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) for storing variables used during program execution.
    
8. **EEPROM**: The ATmega168 version has 512 bytes of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), while the ATmega328 version has 1 KB of EEPROM.
    
9. **USB Interface**: The Arduino Diecimila features a USB interface for programming and serial communication with a computer. It uses the FTDI FT232RL USB-to-serial converter chip for USB communication.
    
10. **Power Options**: The board can be powered via USB connection or an external power supply connected to the DC power jack. It can accept voltages from 7 to 12 volts.
